"""The avatar studio: a new face for the agent, drawn from a description.

The phone has had this since 0.1.20 (``io.github.nanomuse.avatar``); this is the same flow
for the web app and the desktop, run by the runtime so both share it:

1. A chat message asks for a new look ("换个形象：一只橘猫", "new avatar: a robot owl") —
   :func:`parse_request` reads it the way the phone does — or the picker in Settings sends
   the description. The agent is not run for it. A picture attached to the request is the
   *reference*: the candidates are drawn from it (the edit endpoint), so "make it look like
   my cat" keeps the cat — the phone does the same.
2. A card in the chat says what it will cost (``GET /v1/estimate`` on the relay when the
   account's model is the provider; "at your provider's prices" for a key of one's own) and
   waits for a tap.
3. Four candidates are drawn — the same subject four times, different colouring or outfit —
   and shown 2×2 with *redraw*. A tap (or "第二个", "the first one") picks one.
4. The chosen picture is the idle pose; four more are edits of it — working with headphones
   at a laptop, waiting with a crystal ball, happy hugging a star, sorry with a sweat drop —
   the set the dragon has. Each lands in the workspace under ``avatar/<face>/<mood>.webp``
   and the profile's ``avatar`` becomes the face id; the app shows it through
   ``/api/files/avatar/<face>/<mood>.webp``.

Pictures come from the model endpoint the chat uses: the relay speaks the OpenAI images
API (``/v1/images/generations`` and ``/v1/images/edits``), so does any OpenAI-compatible
provider that draws; Alibaba Cloud Model Studio's own host has neither and is called on its
native multimodal endpoint with the same key. Without an image model the chat says so
plainly instead of trying.

5. Once the stills are on, four short clips — idle, working, waiting, happy, the motions the
   dragon's own clips have — are made from them with the video model (the relay's, or Model
   Studio's Wan through the same asynchronous API the phone uses: an upload, a task, polling,
   the MP4), each under ``avatar/<face>/<mood>.mp4``. The web face plays them and falls back
   to the stills where one is missing; an OpenAI-compatible provider without a video API
   simply has stills. The cost card counts the clips too.
