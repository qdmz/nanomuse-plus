"""What the phone tools and the computer tools do the same way.

A *surface* is a screen the hands work on: the phone's, or this computer's. Reading it,
waiting while the user has it, handing it over and taking it back (contract C1 in
docs/browser.md) are the same steps on both; only the words differ. The two tool modules
(:mod:`nanomuse.tools.phone`, :mod:`nanomuse.tools.computer`) each describe their surface
once and call the functions here.
