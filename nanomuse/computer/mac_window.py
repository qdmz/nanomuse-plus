"""Window mode on macOS: the hands work in *one* application's window and leave the rest
of the screen — and the person's cursor — alone.

Screen mode (:mod:`nanomuse.computer.hands`) drives the system mouse: while the operator
clicks, the person cannot. macOS lets a program do better. The window server lists the
windows on screen, one of them can be captured by id, and mouse and keyboard events can be
delivered straight to a process (``CGEventPostToPid``) — the pointer on the desk does not
move, the keyboard focus of the person's own window is not stolen. Typing goes in as unicode
keyboard events, so 中文 and emoji arrive as they are. When Accessibility is granted, a
button under the point can be pressed through the accessibility tree (``AXPress``) instead
of a synthetic click.

Everything that talks to the system is behind :class:`MacAdapter`, a thin protocol with two
real implementations, both imported lazily so this module imports on any platform:

* :class:`OperatorWindowAdapter` — under nanoMuse Desktop, the usual case. The list of
  windows and the picture of one come from the app's helper *nanoMuse Computer Use*
  (``GET /windows``, ``POST /window`` of :mod:`nanomuse.computer.operator`), which holds
  the Screen Recording grant and takes the picture with ScreenCaptureKit on macOS 14 and
  later; the runtime never captures the screen itself there. The events still go out from
  this process through pyobjc (``CGEventPostToPid`` posts to a pid; the helper's own
  ``/execute`` drives the system pointer, which window mode must not touch).
* :class:`QuartzAdapter` — the runtime on its own (no helper bundle, a run outside the
  app): ``CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`` and ``CGWindowListCreateImage`` through pyobjc,
  announced in the log (``window mode: the runtime captures windows itself …``).

The logic above the adapter — choosing a window, mapping the model's coordinates (pixels
of the window picture) to screen points, sequencing the events of a click, a drag, a
scroll, a typed string, a key combination — is :class:`MacWindowHands`, and runs against a
fake adapter in the tests on Linux.

What the person grants once: *Screen Recording* for the capture — the helper's row,
**nanoMuse Computer Use**, under the app; *Accessibility* for the events (``CGEventPostToPid``
needs the posting process to be trusted), which macOS attributes to the *responsible*
application — the desktop app that spawned this runtime — so that row is **nanoMuse** (a
runtime started from a terminal is attributed to that terminal). Without the helper the
capture needs the app's own Screen Recording row as well. The settings page says which is
missing. Everything here fails soft: a window that cannot be found, captured or driven
raises :class:`WindowUnavailable` with the reason (:class:`WindowLayerBroken` when the
layer itself failed), and :class:`~nanomuse.computer.link.ComputerLink` falls back to the
shared screen with a notice.
